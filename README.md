rr-automation
=============

This lesson teaches some tips and tricks that will make life easier with `RMarkdown` if one is using it in the context of a typical research project, which will likely involve multiple sources of raw data that are then combined to create multiple intermediate datasets which then get combined to generate figures and tables.

## Before the lesson starts

- Make sure that participants have the following packages installed:
  - `knitr`
  - `tidyverse`
  - `testthat`
  - `rmarkdown` and `knitr` (in `RStudio` pushing the knit HTML button the first time will prompt to have these packages installed)

- Distribute a Zip file that only contains the content of the
  `example-manuscript` folder from this repository.

- Explain what the handout file contains
